All examples come from live web and SaaS products, so you can see how real teams solve common UX and product problems.

<Callout kind="info">

NicelyDone focuses on **real product UI**, not mockups or concept shots. Every example is a captured screen or flow from an actual product.

## Why NicelyDone exists

Design inspiration is easy to find, but hard to **use** when you are making real product decisions.

Common problems:

- Inspiration scattered across many sites and screenshots
- Hard to search for specific patterns or copy
- Little or no context about how screens connect
- Time lost trying to reconstruct real flows from static shots

NicelyDone exists to solve this by providing:

- A **single place** to browse high-fidelity UI from real products
- **Searchable context**, so you can find examples by what the UI actually says
- **Complete flows**, not just isolated pages

## What you can do with NicelyDone

### Browse the screen library

Explore the **Screen Library** to see individual UI screens in detail:

- Dashboards, settings, onboarding, billing, navigation, and more
- High-resolution captures from real products
- Quickly scan layout, information hierarchy, and interaction patterns

You can filter screens to narrow in on the kinds of products or layouts that match your current work.

### Study complete user flows

Use **User Flows** to understand how screens connect across a journey:

- Onboarding and signup flows
- Pricing and upgrade journeys
- Invite and team management flows
- Verification, recovery, and other critical paths

This helps you see **sequence and context**, not just single-page design decisions.

### Use advanced, text-based search

NicelyDone lets you search by the text that appears **inside** UI screens, such as:

- `"Upgrade plan"`
- `"Invite team"`
- `"Verification code"`
- `"Free trial"`

Combine this with filters to focus on:

- Specific product types (for example, SaaS tools)
- Particular flow types or screen categories

For more details on how to get the most from search, see [Advanced Search](/advanced-search).

### Save and organize inspirations with collections

When you find useful examples, you can save and organize them into **collections**. Collections help you:

- Group examples by project, feature, or team
- Keep a short list of references you want to reuse
- Share aligned references with collaborators

For step-by-step guidance on saving and managing examples, see the help center guide [Save Favorite Designs](/help-center/guides/save-favorite-designs).

## How NicelyDone fits into your workflow

NicelyDone is designed to plug into existing product and design workflows, not replace your tools.

A typical usage pattern:

1. **Define the problem**

   You are designing or revisiting a flow (for example, onboarding, billing, or team invites).

2. **Search for relevant examples**

   Use text-based search and filters to find screens and flows that match your scenario.

3. **Study patterns and trade-offs**

   Compare multiple approaches across products, focusing on copy, layout, and navigation decisions.

4. **Collect references**

   Save the strongest examples into collections tied to your project or feature area.

5. **Translate into your solution**

   Use what you learned to inform wireframes, specs, or design variants in your primary design tool.

6. **Return as the product evolves**

   As you iterate, come back to NicelyDone to see how patterns are changing across the ecosystem.

## Who NicelyDone is for

NicelyDone is built for teams working on modern web and SaaS products, including:

- **Product designers** looking for real-world patterns and copy
- **Product managers** validating flows and UX decisions
- **Founders and early-stage teams** defining product surfaces from scratch
- **Design leaders** building shared references for their teams

If you regularly ask "How do other products handle this?" when designing a feature, NicelyDone is meant for you.

## What makes NicelyDone different

NicelyDone is optimized for **practical product work**, not general inspiration browsing.

| Capability           | NicelyDone | Generic inspiration sites |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Real product UI      | ✅          | ❌                         |
| Full user flows      | ✅          | ❌                         |
| Text-based search    | ✅          | ❌                         |
| Weekly new examples  | ✅          | ❓                         |
| Collections to save  | ✅          | Sometimes                 |

Instead of browsing isolated shots or concepts, you see:

- How real products phrase critical UX copy
- How flows are structured end-to-end
- How patterns differ across tools solving similar problems
