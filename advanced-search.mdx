title: Advanced Search Techniques
description: Learn how to refine your searches and leverage powerful filters to find precise design references efficiently.
---

## Keyword-Based Searching

Start with precise keywords to uncover relevant design inspiration. Combine terms like `dashboard analytics chart` or `user onboarding modal` to narrow results from Nicelydone's 178,400+ screens.

Use quotes for exact phrases: `"pricing table gradient"`. Add operators for better control:

````javascript
// Example search queries
"onboarding flow" AND mobile
dashboard OR admin AND sidebar
NOT legacy
```
````

<Callout kind="tip">
  Prefix keywords with `+` for must-include terms, like `+dark mode +toggle`.
</Callout>

## Advanced Filtering by UI Elements

Refine results using Nicelydone's UI element filters. Access the filter panel on the right sidebar after any search.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Layouts" icon="layout" href="#">
    Filter by grid, card, or list layouts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Components" icon="package" href="#">
    Target buttons, forms, charts, and modals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Themes" icon="palette" href="#">
    Select light/dark modes or color schemes.
  </Card>
</Columns>

| Filter Category | Examples | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Navigation     | Sidebar, Tab bar, Breadcrumbs | App structure discovery |
| Data Display   | Table, Chart, Timeline | Analytics UI patterns |
| Interactions   | Dropdown, Slider, Tooltip | User input components |

Apply multiple filters simultaneously for precision, such as `charts` + `dark mode` + `SaaS dashboard`.

## Exporting and Sharing Collections

Build and share custom collections from your searches. Click "Save to Collection" on any screen or flow.

<Expandable title="Advanced Export Options" default-open="false">
  Export formats include:
  - PDF (with annotations)
  - ZIP of screenshots
  - Shareable links (public or team-only)

  <CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
  ````bash
  nicelydone export collection-id=abc123 --format=pdf
  ````
  ````javascript
  await nicelydone.exportCollection('abc123', { format: 'pdf' });
  ````
  </CodeGroup>
